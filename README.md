The objective of this project is to implement and explore different Time series Forecasting techniques like ARIMA, SARIMA, PROPHET and XGBOOST on a relatively simple and clean dataset.
A Time Series is defined as a series of data points recorded at different time intervals. The time order can be daily, monthly, or even yearly.

Time Series forecasting is the process of using a statistical model to predict future values of a time series based on past results.
