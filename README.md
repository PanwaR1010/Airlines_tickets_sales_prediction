# Airlines_tickets_sales_prediction
The objective of this project is to implement and explore different Time series Forecasting techniques like ARIMA, SARIMA, PROPHET and XGBOOST on a relatively simple and clean dataset.

A Time Series is defined as a series of data points recorded at different time intervals. The time order can be daily, monthly, or even yearly.

Time Series forecasting is the process of using a statistical model to predict future values of a time series based on past results.


# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is International airline passengers dataset. It contains monthly total number of passengers (in thousands) and has two columns â€“ month and count of passengers.
